## Purpose
  The purpose of this website is to showcase my abilities as a front-end developer to potential employers
  and colleagues.

  This website acts as my personal page on the internet and shows who I am to the world so that anyone curious
  to see what I'm about or wants to know who I am or what I have done can quickly find the information digitally.

## Functionality / features
  This site has three main components: 1) the hamburger menu, 2) the index/splash page and 3) the content pages.

  The hamburger menu appears on all pages of the site. It is a responsive, pure css solution, that let's users
  navigate between all the different pages in a seamless way. A user visiting the site will be taken to the
  splash/index page where they can then either follow the social icons or click on the hamburger menu.
  The hamburger menu, once clicked, expands and shows the different pages a user can visit.
  The menu expands to encompass the whole screen. and lists out all options in a repsonsive way (menu items
  will always be in the middle regardless of screen size of device type).

  The Index/splash (index.html) page has it's own structure and looks different than all other pages. It is the very first page that a User sees when they follow the home link to the website. This page has a different structure
  to all other pages. It will display my first name and last name, along with some introductory text and social
  icons (linkedin and github in this case).
  This page is responsive so it will have the same structure across different screen sizes and devices with
  with minor changes to font-size and positioning in order to maintain the desired design effect.

  The content page structure holds the html structure for all other pages in the site. The first and last name are located to the top-right hand corner, will content starting on the intersection between both names.
  Social links are also now located underneath the last name across the pages with content.
  Content is very varied in this site. It ranges from a few p tages holding text to a list of articles in the blog to a projects page holding divs of images and text and links inside each div.
  These content pages are also responsive to different devices and screen-sizes and have the same desired design effect as the rest of the website.
