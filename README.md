## Purpose
  The purpose of this website is to showcase my abilities as a front-end developer to potential employers
  and colleagues.

  This website acts as my personal page on the internet and shows who I am to the world so that anyone curious
  to see what I'm about or wants to know who I am or what I have done can quickly find the information digitally.

## Functionality / features
  This site has three main components: 1) the hamburger menu, 2) the index/splash page and 3) the content pages.

  The hamburger menu appears on all pages of the site. It is a responsive, pure css solution, that let's users
  navigate between all the different pages in a seamless way. A user visiting the site will be taken to the
  splash/index page where they can then either follow the social icons or click on the hamburger menu.
  The hamburger menu, once clicked, expands and shows the different pages a user can visit.
  The menu expands to encompass the whole screen. and lists out all options in a repsonsive way (menu items
  will always be in the middle regardless of screen size of device type).

  The Index/splash page has it's own structure and looks different than all other pages. It is the very first page that a User sees when they follow the home link to the website.
